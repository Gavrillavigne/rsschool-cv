  <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Desired Position: Full Stack Web Developer</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATION</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Quite seriously I began to study PHP and related technologies about two years ago. Before that time, I studied
      theory, watched video courses, solved simple tasks. Soon I realized that without serious practice I would spent
      very much time on my training. So I decided to write my first project (you can see the link to the project
      repository in the CV below).
      I wrote the project without the use of CMS and frameworks to understand Web technologies better. But in my project
      I trying to use OOP, MVC pattern and database management system MySQL. After the completion of the current project
      I’m planning to write a project using the framework (probably it will be Yii2).
      I also have commercial development experience. About six months I work as a Junior PHP Developer. I develop and
      refinement of existing functionality for the company’s CRM system using the Yii2 framework.</p>
