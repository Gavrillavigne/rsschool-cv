# SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATION
>Quite seriously I began to study PHP and related technologies about two years ago. Before that time, I studied theory, watched video courses, solved simple tasks. Soon I realized that without serious practice I would spent very much time on my training. So I decided to write my first project (you can see the link to the project repository in the CV below).
I wrote the project without the use of CMS and frameworks to understand Web technologies better. But in my project I trying to use OOP, MVC pattern and database management system MySQL. After the completion of the current project I'm planning to write a project using the framework (probably it will be Yii2).
I also have commercial development experience. About six months I work as a Junior PHP Developer. I develop and refinement of existing functionality for the company's CRM system using the Yii2 framework.
